  <h3>Section 4.1</h3>
  <h1>DISM</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Dism.exe, or the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool, is a command-line tool built into Windows. It's designed for manipulating WIM package data, and allows SLIPS7REAM to do everything it does.</p>
  <p>Information about DISM is available from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371719.aspx" title="Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) (Windows)" target="_blank">MSDN <img src="/link.png" alt=""></a>.</p>
  <p>By default, SLIPS7REAM does not actually use this copy of Dism.exe unless no copy exists in your System32 folder. DISM should be included in all compatible Operating Systems already.</p>
  <p>SLIPS7REAM 3.0 includes Dism.exe v6.1.7600.16385, but uses whichever version is already installed if it's not older.</p>
