  <p>Making an All-in-One installer is easy with SLIPS7REAM! Simply follow the instructions below to create your very own Windows 7 AIO ISO.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Make sure you have your <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.1_32-bit.htm" title="Glossary - 32-bit / x86">32-bit</a> and <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-bit / x64 / amd64">64-bit</a> images ready, as well as any Service Pack, Update, Language Pack, and Driver files you want to include. See the <a href="/3_Slipstream_Process/3.1_Integration_Tutorial_(ISO).htm" title="Slipstream Process - Integration Tutorial (ISO)">Integration Tutorial</a> for a good simple file structure.<br>
    If you're integrating Enterprise, do that first - Select your RTM <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.1_INSTALL.WIM.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - INSTALL.WIM">INSTALL.WIM</a> or ISO for Windows 7 x86, then select the Windows 7 x86 Enterprise Edition to <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.2_Merge_WIM.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Merge WIM">merge</a>. Remember, if you use a raw WIM file, you should make a new copy of your original INSTALL.WIM and select that, as SLIPS7REAM will directly integrate Enterprise into the WIM. If you use an ISO, just select a new destination ISO under the &quot;<a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.6_Save_to_ISO.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Save to ISO">Save to ISO</a>&quot; field.<br>
    Of course, do the same for the 64-bit version after your 32-bit merge is complete.
   </li>
   <li>
    Select your 32-bit image under &quot;INSTALL.WIM&quot; and your 64-bit image under &quot;Merge WIM&quot;, of course choosing a new &quot;Save to ISO&quot; destination for the final ISO, or using a new copy of your 32-bit image if you're working directly with WIM files.<br>
    If you want to include a <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.4_Service_Pack.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Service Pack">Service Pack</a> or <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.1_Add_Updates.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Updates - Add Updates">Updates</a>, now would be a good time. Remember to select both an x86 Service Pack 1.exe and x64 Service Pack 1.exe in the right fields, and both 32 and 64-bit variants of any Windows Updates and/or Drivers you want in all Editions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Remember to check the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.7_ISO_Features/1.7.2_Unlock_All_Editions.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - ISO Features - Unlock All Editions">Unlock All Editions</a> checkbox, and to select a 32-bit Image if you are saving to an ISO.<br>
    When you're ready, hit the &quot;Begin&quot; button. SLIPS7REAM will automatically merge your 32-bit and 64-bit <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Image Packages">Image Packages</a> into one WIM, then add whatever other files you have selected. Finally, it will compress the image, and if instructed, create a finalized ISO.
   </li>
  </ol>
