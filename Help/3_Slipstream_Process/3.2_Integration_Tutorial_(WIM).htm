  <h3>Section 3.2</h3>
  <h1>Integration Tutorial (WIM)</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>This tutorial will walk you through <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.1_Add_Updates.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Updates - Add Updates">integrating Windows Updates</a> (including Internet Explorer) into a <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.8_Image.htm" title="Glossary - Image / WIM">Windows Image</a>. If you have trouble with Slips7ream or are a beginner at the Slipstreaming process, you may want to consult this guide.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>I suggest you start by setting up a folder for Slipstreaming if you are going to be doing this regularly, so I'll be using the following directory tree for this tutorial:</p>
  <dl>
   <dt>C:\Users\&#8203;Admin\Documents\&#8203;Win7_ISO\32-Bit\</dt>
   <dd>
    You can use any location you want, C:\Users\&#8203;Admin\Documents\ is just the path used in the example
    <dl>
     <dt>IE11\</dt>
     <dd>
      This folder contains Internet Explorer 11 and its prerequisites (minus ones that are unnecessary when using KB3125574)
      <dl>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB2639308-x86.msu</dt>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB2670838-x86.msu</dt>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB2729094-v2-x86.msu</dt>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB2834140-x86.msu</dt>
       <dt>IE11-Windows6.1-x86-en-us.exe</dt>
       <dd>This is the offline installer for Internet Explorer 11 (English). If you want to include Spelling and Hyphenation packages for other languages, you can use their EXEs as well</dd>
      </dl>
     </dd>
     <dt>Updates\</dt>
     <dd>
      This folder contains the updates that will be integrated. For this example, only three updates will be used
      <dl>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB3125574-v4-x86.dt</dt>
       <dd>The Windows 7 Convenience rollup Update</dd>
       <dt>Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu</dt>
       <dd>The prerequisite for KB3125574</dt>
       <dt>IE11-Windows6.1-KB3154070-x86.msu</dt>
       <dd>The latest Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11 (as of April 2016)</dd>
      </dl>
     </dd>
     <dt>SP1.exe</dt>
     <dd>the 32-Bit Windows 7 Service Pack 1 offline installer</dd>
     <dt>Win7.wim</dt>
     <dd>a copy of INSTALL.WIM from the Windows 7 RTM ISO, which will contain the final version</dd>
    </dl>
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The first step is to select your source and destination <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.1_INSTALL.WIM.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - INSTALL.WIM">INSTALL.WIM</a>, &quot;Win7.wim&quot;.<br>
    Click the &quot;Browse...&quot; button next to the INSTALL.WIM field to select &quot;C:\Users\&#8203;Admin\Documents\&#8203;Win7_ISO\32-Bit\&#8203;Win7.wim&quot;. You can also drag-and-drop the file into the field with your mouse.<br>
    Slips7ream will automatically read the INSTALL.WIM file's properties, giving you a list of <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages">Image Packages</a>.
   </li>
   <li>
    You can optionally <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.2_Merge_WIM.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Merge WIM">include</a> or remove Image Packages as needed. All the Updates will be integrated into all of the finalized Image Packages automatically.<br>
    You can also <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.1_Parse_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Parse Packages">read more package data</a> from the Image Packages if you want to <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.2_Package_Properties/1.3.2.1_Windows_Features.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Package Properties - Windows Features">change Features</a>, <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.2_Package_Properties/1.3.2.2_Integrated_Windows_Updates.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Package Properties - Integrated Windows Updates">remove Updates</a>, or just see what's already installed. Having a list of Integrated Updates will also ensure that there aren't version conflicts between Updates.
   </li>
   <li>
    Next, click the &quot;Service Pack&quot; checkbox to enable the Service Pack field(s). Click &quot;Browse...&quot; next to the Service Pack field and choose &quot;SP1.exe&quot;, or drag-and-drop the file into the right field.<br>
    Note that if you have mixed <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.1_32-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 32-Bit / x86">32-Bit</a> and <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-Bit / x64 / amd64">64-Bit</a> architectures in your Image Packages list, there will be two fields, one for the x86 Service Pack, one for x64.
   </li>
   <li>
    After providing the Service Pack, it's time to add some <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.0_Updates.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Updates">Updates</a>.<br>
    Click on &quot;Add to Updates...&quot; and open the &quot;IE11&quot; folder, then select all of the prerequisite MSU files in this folder and click &quot;Open&quot;.<br>
    When all of the selected files have been added to the Updates list, click &quot;Add to Updates...&quot; again to add &quot;IE11-Windows6.1-x86-en-us.exe&quot;.<br>
    As before, you can also drag the files (or the &quot;IE11&quot; folder) into the Updates list to add them. You can also re-order the files in the list by dragging one or more selected Updates up or down, or by right-clicking your selection and choosing a menu item.
   </li>
   <li>Practice adding Updates by including the files in the &quot;Updates&quot; folder as well.</li>
   <li>
    If you want to put your selected INSTALL.WIM into an ISO, you can check the <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.6_Save_to_ISO.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Save to ISO">Save to ISO</a> checkbox and select a copy of the Windows 7 RTM ISO.<br>
    Note that this will still alter the INSTALL.WIM file's contents, it will simply also place it into an <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.3_Disc.htm" title="Glossary - Disc / ISO">ISO</a>.
   <li>
    Now it's time to begin the Slipstream operation: click &quot;Begin&quot; at the bottom of the window to start the process, then sit back and wait as Slips7ream does its work.<br>
    When the process is complete, you can click the &quot;Open Folder&quot; button to open the folder containing your selected INSTALL.WIM file, &quot;Win7.wim&quot;. You can copy this WIM to a USB installer's &quot;/sources/&quot; folder and rename it INSTALL.WIM for quick updating of a flash drive, or store the file for later updating.
