  <h1>Package Properties</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Each <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Image Packages">Image Package</a> has a range of detailed properties describing the Package. SLIPS7REAM allows you to view all of these properties through an advanced Image Package Properties Window. Below is a description of each entry.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Index</b>: This is the index of the Image Package in its parent WIM file. Indexes start from 1. This is the order in which the Installer will list your Operating System choices.</li>
   <li><b>Name</b>: The name by which the Image Package is identified when working with WIM files, and what will be shown in the list of Operating Systems during Installation. The Name can be edited to be anything you want, but it must be unique in the Image, so please make sure that no two Packages use the same Name.</li>
