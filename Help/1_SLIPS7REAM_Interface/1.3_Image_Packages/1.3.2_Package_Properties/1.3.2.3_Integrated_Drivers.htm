  <h3>Section 1.3.2.3</h3>
  <h1>Integrated Drivers</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Integrated Drivers list can be found to the right of the Package Properties list, below Integrated Windows Updates. This list includes all the Drivers which have already been integrated into the Image Package.</p>
  <p>You can populate the list of drivers by clicking on the &quot;<img src="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/load_driver.png" alt="">Load Integrated Drivers List&quot; button, or by using the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.1_Parse_Packages.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Image Packages - Parse Packages">Parse Packages</a> feature.</p>
  <p>Once the Driver Class list has been loaded, you will be able to select one of the Classes to get a list of Providers and INF Files. Choosing a different Class or Provider will list the INF Files that match. You can uncheck an INF file to remove it from the Image Package. Double-Clicking an INF File will display the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.3_Driver_Properties.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Updates - Driver Properties">Driver's Properties</a>.</p>
  <p>If you come across a Provider that is missing its icon (showing instead <img src="oem.png" alt="the Windows Logo with the letters OEM">), please <a href="mailto:webmaster@RealityRipple.com" title="Send an E-Mail to webmaster@RealityRipple.com">contact me</a> and I will include a company logo for the Provider in the next version of SLIPS7REAM.</p>
  <p>Please note that you must run the <a href="/3_Slipstream_Process/3.0_Slipstream_Process.htm" title="Slipstream Process">Slipstream Process</a> before any settings will be changed.</p>
