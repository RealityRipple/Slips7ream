  <h3>Section 1.3.2.2</h3>
  <h1>Integrated Windows Updates</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Integrated Windows Updates list can be found to the right of the Package Properties list, below Windows Features. This list includes all the Updates and Language Packs which have already been integrated into the Image Package.</p>
  <p>You can populate the list of Updates by clicking on the &quot;<img src="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/load_update.png" alt="">Load Integrated Windows List&quot; button, or by using the <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.1_Parse_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Parse Packages">Parse Packages</a> feature.</p>
  <p>Once the list has been loaded, you can uncheck the checkbox next to any Update which you would like to remove. It's important to note that Updates with the State &quot;Uninstall Pending&quot; or &quot;Superseded&quot; can not be removed this way, but will be removed during installation.</p>
  <p>Please note that you must run the <a href="/3_Slipstream_Process/3.0_Slipstream_Process.htm" title="Slipstream Process">Slipstream Process</a> before any settings will be changed.</p>
