  <h3>Section 1.3.2.1</h3>
  <h1>Windows Features</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Windows Features list can be found to the right of the Package Properties list. This list is almost identical to the &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; interface in Windows, with a few minor changes.</p>
  <p>You can populate the list of features by clicking on the &quot;<img src="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/load_feature.png" alt="">Load Windows Features List&quot; button, or by using the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.1_Parse_Packages.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Image Packages - Parse Packages">Parse Packages</a> feature.</p>
  <p>Once the list has been loaded, you can select the features you want enabled or disabled by default in this Operating System. The list is designed to enable any required features when you enable a feature that has requirements, and to disable features if a requirement is disabled. You may also receive notices about features being required for parts of the Operating System to run.</p>
  <p>Please note that you must run the <a href="/3_Slipstream_Process/3.0_Slipstream_Process.htm" title="Slipstream Process">Slipstream Process</a> before any settings will be changed.</p>
