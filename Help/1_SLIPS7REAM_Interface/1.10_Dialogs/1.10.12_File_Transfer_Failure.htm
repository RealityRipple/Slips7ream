  <h1>Unable to transfer file</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>If, during the moving or copying of a large file fails, you may receive a File Transfer Failure message. The error message should provide you with all the details regarding the problem. The most common issues are running out of drive space, not having access to the file (or the file is missing), or even file corruption.</p>
