  <h1>Active mount has been detected</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>If DISM or ImageX fails to unmount and cleanup any Mount Paths, you may receive this error. Occasionally, a path will remain active, particularly if there was an error or failure during Image Package activities. You can resolve this error manually by clearing the file lock by hand, changing the <a href="/2_Configuration/2.1_Temp_Directory_Path.htm" title="Configuration - Temp Directory Path">Temp Directory Path</a>, or simply restarting your computer.</p>
