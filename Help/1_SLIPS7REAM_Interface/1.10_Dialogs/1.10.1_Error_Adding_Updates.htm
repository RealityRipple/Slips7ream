  <h3>Section 1.10.1</h3>
  <h1>Unable to add files to the Update List</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>You may receive this error while <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.1_Add_Updates.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Updates - Add Updates">adding files</a> to the <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.0_Updates.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Updates">Update List</a>. The &quot;View Details&quot; button on the dialog will provide specific details.</p>
  <p>
   The reasons for an update not being included are:
   <ul>
    <li><b>Description/Properties File Not Found</b>: the file that describes the update (usually an &quot;update.mum&quot; inside a compressed file) was not found in the expected location. This is often a sign of a corrupt file or a file that isn't supported. Other Description file errors may occur with the same general meaning and further details as to the nature of the problem.</li>
    <li>Errors during file extraction such as <b>CRC Errors</b>, <b>Data Errors</b>, <b>Unsupported Method</b>, <b>File Not Found</b> and other <b>Extraction Error</b> messages.</li>
    <li><b>Unknown file type</b>: Slips7ream only allows the following file types: CAB, MLC, MSI, MSU, EXE, and INF. Other file types are not supported.</li>
    <li><b>Update not found</b>: the file doesn't exist. It may have been deleted or moved, or the drive or path may not be accessible.</li>
   </ul>
