  <h3>Section 1.10.9</h3>
  <h1>Unable to find parent directory</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>If you choose a Temp directory path that doesn't exist, SLIPS7REAM will prompt you to select one. The Temp directory is where SLIPS7REAM does all its work, so please select a location that can handle at least a dozen gigabytes of temporary data.</p>
  <p>Note that the &quot;Slips7ream&quot; folder in the Temp directory will be created and deleted by the program repeatedly - it's the parent directory that has to exist. By default, SLIPS7REAM uses your computer's TEMP directory: &quot;C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Temp\&quot;.</p>
