  <h1>Dependent Windows features will be turned off</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>When disabling <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.2_Package_Properties/1.3.2.1_Windows_Features.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Package Properties - Windows Features">Windows Features</a> in the <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages">Image Packages window</a>, you may receive a dialog that notifies you that other Windows features and programs on your computer might also be affected if you disable the feature you're trying to disable. If you don't want to continue, you can hit &quot;No&quot; and the feature will remain enabled. In many cases, a hyperlink in the dialog will provide a page with more information from Microsoft.</p>
  <a name="missing"></a>
  <p>If you enable a feature and receive an error dialog that says &quot;<b>A required feature is missing from the feature list</b>&quot;, you may have a modified or damaged Windows Image Package, or the Feature list may not have been completely or correctly <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.1_Parse_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages - Parse Packages">loaded</a>. In either case, a feature that is required for the selected feature could not be found in the list, so the selected feature will not be enabled.</p>
