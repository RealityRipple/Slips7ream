  <h3>Section 1.10.13</h3>
  <h1>Busy with another task</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>SLIPS7REAM can only run one task at a time for the sake of hard drive efficiency. If you receive an error telling you that SLIPS7REAM is busy with another task, that means the operation you requested can't be performed until whatever other operation SLIPS7REAM is working on has completed. You can tell when SLIPS7REAM is busy because the main window's header will show an animation and display the current activity. If the header is a simple gradient with SLIPS7REAM and the version number, SLIPS7REAM is not busy and you can attempt this task again.</p>
