  <h3>Section 1.11</h3>
  <h1>Output Console</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
   The Output Console displays the command line calls and raw output from the <a href="/4_Included_External_Tools/4.0_Included_External_Tools.htm" title="Included External Tools">tools</a> which Slips7ream uses. You can access the Output Console by clicking the down-pointing chevron in the circle in the bottom left corner of the interface.<br>
   The console has its own miniature title bar which can be dragged away from the rest of the Slips7ream interface to pull it out into its own window. This window can be resized and docked on any side of the Slips7ream interface for easier reading in cases of technical issues. Closing this window or clicking the now up-pointing chevron in the circle will hide the Output Console once again, but will not clear the contents.<br>
   If you want to clear the Output Console, just right-click its contents and hit the &quot;Clear&quot; menu item. You can also select and copy the contents (or just the commands without the output) of the console through the context menu. This can be especially helpful if you wish to make a quick batch script or reproduce steps later.
