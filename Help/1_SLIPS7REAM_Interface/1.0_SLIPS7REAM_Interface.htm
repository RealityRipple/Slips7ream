  <h1>SLIPS7REAM Interface</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Interface of SLIPS7REAM may look daunting to begin with, but its features are clean, organized, and to the point.</p>
  <p>
   The interface is split up into three main parts: the Operating Systems, the Updates, and the ISO options.<br>
   The top of the interface is a large blue bar which displays any operation in progress.<br>
   Below that are the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.1_INSTALL.WIM.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - INSTALL.WIM">INSTALL.WIM</a> and Merge WIM fields, the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Image Packages">Image Packages</a> list, and the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.4_Service_Pack.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Service Pack">Service Pack</a> entries. These items all reside above a resizable splitter in the middle of the interface.<br>
   The Updates field below this splitter let you add, remove, organize, and view details about Windows Updates, Drivers, and Language Packs that will be added to all supported Image Packages.<br>
   The Save to ISO field and the following ISO features let you save your INSTALL.WIM to an ISO Image which can be burned directly to a Disc.<br>
   Finally, a few remaining features such as the Process Priority and On Completion fields round out the interface, with just enough space for the Debug arrow, Activity label, and Configuration button.
