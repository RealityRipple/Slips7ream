  <h3>Section 1.5.3</h3>
  <h1>Driver Properties</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Driver Properties Window can be a little confusing. Each driver contains some basic information about the driver and the driver's Class, as well as a list of compatible Architectures. For each architecture, there's a list of compatible Hardware, each with its own details including Hardware IDs, which contain relevant Compatible and Exclude IDs.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Original Name</b>: Only included in Integrated Drivers. This was the name of the INF before it was integrated.</li>
   <li><b>Published Name</b>: In Integrated Drivers, this is the new name of the INF after integration. In the Updates list, this is the path where the driver INF file is located.</li>
   <li><b>Driver Store Path</b>: In Integrated Drivers, this is the location where the INF and any other Driver files are stored. In the Updates list, this is the same as the Published Name.</li>
   <li><b>In-Box</b>: Only included in Integrated Drivers. If the value is Yes, then this driver was included with the original Operating System release. If No, the driver was integrated later. In-Box drivers can not be removed.</li>
   <li><b>Provider Name</b>: The company that wrote the Driver. Not necessarily the same as the Hardware Manufacturer.</li>
   <li><b>Date</b>: This is the date the driver was written.</li>
   <li><b>Version</b>: This is the version of the driver. The driver version is usually the same as the OS version for drivers that came with Windows.</li>
   <li>
    <b>Boot Critical</b>: If Yes, then this driver is critical for booting Windows when in use.
    <ul>
     <li><b>Boot-critical drivers</b> are reflected. In other words, the files are copied into the image according to what's specified in the .inf file. The PC completes installation tasks during the initial boot, including updating the Critical Devices Database (CDDB) and the registry.</li>
     <li><b>Drivers that aren't boot critical</b> are staged. In other words, they're added to the driver store. After Windows starts, PnP detects the device and installs the matching driver from the driver store.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li><b>Driver Class</b>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Name</b>: The Class Name, identifying what kind of hardware this driver describes.</li>
     <li><b>Description</b>: Usually a slightly more descriptive version of the Class Name.</li>
     <li><b>GUID</b>: The Class GUID, which universally identifies the Driver Class.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li><b>Architecture</b>: The Architecture dropdown includes all compatible CPU Architectures included in the driver. Selecting an Architecture entry will re-populate the Hardware dropdown (see Below).</a>
   <li><b>Hardware</b>: The Hardware dropdown includes all compatible hardware for the selected CPU Architecture included in the driver. Selecting a Hardware entry will re-populate the Hardware Description entries (see Below).</a>
   <li><b>Hardware Description</b>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Service Name</b>: The short name of the Windows Service which this driver is attached to.</li>
     <li><b>Architecture</b>: Usually redundant with the Architecture dropdown (see Above).</li> 
     <li><b>Manufacturer</b>: The name of the company that created the hardware.</li>
     <li><b>Hardware IDs</b>: A list of all the Hardware IDs supported by this driver. Selecting an ID will re-populate the Compatible IDs and Exclude IDs lists (see Below).</li>
     <li><b>Compatible IDs</b>: A list of any Hardware IDs that should be included in support along with the selected Hardware ID (see Above).</li>
     <li><b>Exclude IDs</b>: A list of any Hardware IDs that should be excluded from support in the range defined by the selected Hardware ID (see Above).</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
