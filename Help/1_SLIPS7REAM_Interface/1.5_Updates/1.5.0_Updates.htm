  <h3>Section 1.5</h3>
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Updates list includes all Windows Updates, Language Packs, and Drivers that are going to be integrated into each <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.3_Image_Packages/1.3.0_Image_Packages.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Image Packages">Image Package</a>. The order of the items in the list can be changed by dragging items around or by right-clicking items and using the context menu options.</p>
  <p>If there is an issue with an Update, the color of the list item's text will be different: Details about the issue can be found in the Tooltip of the item if you hover the mouse over it for a moment. Red text means that there is an integration issue, and Orange text means that a requirement may not be included.</p>
  <p>Drivers have an extra feature within the Updates list. If you use the <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.6_Save_to_ISO.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Save to ISO">Save to ISO</a> feature, you'll see two context menu items for Drivers that aren't normally there: &quot;Include Drivers in PE&quot; and &quot;Include Drivers in Setup&quot;. As suggested, this allows you to integrate proprietary drivers into your BOOT.WIM file. Please note that &quot;PE&quot; is the Windows Setup Pre-Environment, while &quot;Setup&quot; is used for repairs. Confusing, I know, but that's the way Microsoft named them. The color of the driver's text will change depending on what you select: Blue for PE, Green for Setup, and Purple for both.</p>
