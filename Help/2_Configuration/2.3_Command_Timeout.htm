  <h3>Section 2.3</h3>
  <h1>Command Timeout</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>This field sets how long SLIPS7REAM will wait for a response from an <a href="/4_Included_External_Tools/4.0_Included_External_Tools.htm" title="Included External Tools">external process</a>. SLIPS7REAM makes calls to programs such as <a href="/4_Included_External_Tools/4.1_DISM.htm" title="Included External Tools - DISM">DISM</a> frequently, and can be told to fail if these calls take too long.</p>
  <p>By default, the Command Timeout feature is disabled (with a value of 0), which means that SLIPS7REAM will wait until the program closes on its own before continuing.</p>
