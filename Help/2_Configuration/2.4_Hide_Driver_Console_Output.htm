  <h3>Section 2.4</h3>
  <h1>Hide Driver Console Output</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>This checkbox controls whether or not SLIPS7REAM's console will display output when parsing details about drivers, both integrated and from INF files. Drivers can often have a large number of compatible hardware IDs, and iterating through them all can take quite a bit of time. It can also fill up the console window in a matter of seconds.</p>
  <p>By default, Driver outputs are hidden to keep the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.11_Output_Console.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Output Console">Output Console</a> a little cleaner and prevent excessive loading times when reading major driver packages. You can turn this feature off if you want to see everything in the console, or if you're looking for a problem with a driver file.</p>
