  <h3>Section 5.1</h3>
  <h1>32-bit / x86</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The x86 architecture was made for IBM's 286 processor and is well known for the 32-bit limitation of what's essentially 4 GB. Many <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.6_File_System.htm" title="Glossary - File System">File Systems</a> still suffer from this limitation, including ISO/9960.</p>
  <p>Windows 7's 32-bit flavor has been fully supported by Microsoft, and in fact the &quot;Starter Edition&quot; is only available in 32-bit, likely due to the fact that <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-bit / x64 / amd64">64-bit</a> Operating Systems contain all the files of the 32-bit ones for full compatibility with 32-bit programs.</p>
  <p>SLIPS7REAM uses the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.2_Update_Properties.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Updates - Update Properties">Update's Properties</a> to determine its architecture and match it against every <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.9_Image_Package.htm" title="Glossary - Image Package">Image Package</a> in the <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.1_INSTALL.WIM.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - INSTALL.WIM">selected</a> <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.8_Image.htm" title="Glossary - Image / WIM">Image</a>(<a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.2_Merge_WIM.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Merge WIM">s</a>), allowing for quick updating of All-In-One packages or other images with mixed architectures.</p>
  <p>The <a href="/2_Configuration/2.2_Update_Whitelist.htm" title="Configuration - x86 Update Whitelist">x86 Update Whitelist</a> allows 32-bit updates to be installed on 64-bit Operating Systems when necessary, such as the Spelling and Hyphenation Packs for Internet Explorer. However, this is not a reversible process. 64-bit Updates, Drivers, Applications, and Language Packs will <i>never</i> work on 32-bit Operating Systems, and similarly, Windows 7 <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.13_Service_Pack.htm" title="Glossary - Service Pack">Service Pack</a> 1 requires a 64-bit Operating System when <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.4_Service_Pack.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Service Pack">integrating</a> into a 64-bit Image Package.</p>
