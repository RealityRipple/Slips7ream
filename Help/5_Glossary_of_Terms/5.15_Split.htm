  <h1>Split</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>A File Split is a collection of two or more files that actually contain contiguous data normally contained in one file. The most common reason to Split a file is because of <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.6_File_System.htm" title="Glossary - File System">File System</a> restrictions or <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.3_Disc.htm" title="Glossary - Disc / ISO">Disc</a> space.</p>
  <p>Slips7ream can  <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.7_ISO_Features/1.7.5_Split_Method.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - ISO Features - Split Method">Split</a> a <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.8_Image.htm" title="Glossary - Image / WIM">WIM</a> or ISO into sections to fit CDs, DVDs, Blu-Rays, or any custom size. When WIM files are split into pieces, the file type becomes SWM instead, and can be stored on different Discs which the Windows 7 Installer will ask for during installation. Slips7ream automatically places the optimal amount of WIMs on each Disc depending on file size, and includes a tiny AutoRun program to let you know it's a Data Disc, not the Setup Disc.</p>
