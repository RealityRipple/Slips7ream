  <h3>Section 5.5</h3>
  <h1>Driver</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>A Driver INF File is basically an identification for a piece of hardware, often with software included to make use hardware functions. <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-Bit / x64 / amd64">64-Bit</a> Operating Systems require Drivers to be digitally signed by default; however SLIPS7REAM can still <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.1_Add_Updates.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Add Updates">integrate</a> unsigned Drivers for user convenience.</p>
  <p>SLIPS7REAM allows integration of Drivers that are almost identical, including newer and older versions of Drivers, because Windows stores backups for Rollback and other compatibility resolutions. Some Drivers also may include important Hardware IDs that newer or older versions do not. SLIPS7REAM will, however, warn you if you try to integrate an <i>identical</i> Driver.</p>
