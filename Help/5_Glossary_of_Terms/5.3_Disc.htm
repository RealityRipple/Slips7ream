  <h3>Section 5.3</h3>
  <h1>Disc / ISO</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>An ISO or Disc Image is an exact copy of the data on a CD, DVD, or similar storage media. They're a common way to backup actual Discs onto hard drives, and many Operating System makers such as Microsoft and the Linux community use ISO files to distribute their products.</p>
  <p>Slips7ream can read ISO files using <a href="/4_Included_External_Tools/4.5_7z.dll.htm" title="Included External Tools - 7z.dll">7-zip</a>, and create them using <a href="/4_Included_External_Tools/4.3_OSCDIMG.htm" title="Included External Tools - OSCDIMG">OSCDIMG</a>, allowing you to manipulate ISOs or <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.8_Image.htm" title="Glossary - Image / WIM">WIMs</a> interchangeably. It can also <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.15_Split.htm" title="Glossary - Split">Split</a> up the Windows 7 Installer into multiple ISOs. Slips7ream does not, however, generate Windows 7 installer data automatically, so when <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.6_Save_to_ISO.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Save to ISO">saving to an ISO</a>, it is important to select an ISO that already exists for Slips7ream to place the WIM into. It's also important to use a 32-Bit ISO when making an All-In-One or mixed architecture installer, because <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.1_32-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 32-bit / x86">32-Bit</a> processors can not read <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-Bit / x64 / amd64">64-Bit</a> files.</p>
