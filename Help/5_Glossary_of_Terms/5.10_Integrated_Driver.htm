  <h3>Section 5.10</h3>
  <h1>Integrated Driver</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>An Integrated Driver is a <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.5_Driver.htm" title="Glossary - Driver">Driver INF</a> that has been <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.14_Slipstream.htm" title="Glossary - Slipstream">Slipstreamed</a> into an <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.9_Image_Package.htm" title="Glossary - Image Package">Image Package</a>. Windows 7 comes with around 500 Drivers &quot;In-Box&quot;, but does not include some proprietary SATA controllers and other potentially vital hardware Drivers. SLIPS7REAM lets you <a href="/1_SLIPS7REAM_Interface/1.5_Updates/1.5.1_Add_Updates.htm" title="SLIPS7REAM Interface - Updates - Add Updates">integrate</a> <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.5_Driver.htm" title="Glossary - Driver">Drivers</a> so you don't have to provide them by hand during installation.</p>
  <p>Some Drivers are required to boot Windows and should not be removed, particularly processors, disk controllers, and system devices. Be careful if you decide to remove Integrated Drivers.</p>
  <p>SLIPS7REAM allows integration of Drivers that are almost identical, including newer and older versions of Drivers, because Windows stores backups for Rollback and other compatibility resolutions. Some Drivers also may include important Hardware IDs that newer or older versions do not. SLIPS7REAM will, however, warn you if you try to integrate an <i>identical</i> Driver.</p>
