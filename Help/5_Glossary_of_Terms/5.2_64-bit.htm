  <h1>64-Bit / x64 / amd64</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The 64-Bit processor we use today was designed by AMD back in the early 2000s when the <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.1_32-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 32-Bit / x86">32-Bit</a> limit began looming. It successfully took over the market share of both Desktop and Server processors despite <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.7_IA64.htm" title="Glossary - IA64 / Itanium">Intel's Itanium</a> server processor's competition. Today, most people have 64-Bit desktops and laptops.</p>
