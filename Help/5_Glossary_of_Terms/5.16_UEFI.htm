  <h3>Section 5.16</h3>
  <h1>UEFI</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is a replacement to the ancient concept of a BIOS or CMOS on a PC Motherboard. UEFI only works with <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-Bit / x64 / amd64">64-Bit</a> Windows, and can not read the UDF <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.6_File_System.htm" title="Glossary - File System">File System</a> or files larger than 4095 MB during setup. Windows 7 also does not have the drivers to support a video card under UEFI, so a Legacy Graphics or Compatibility Module option is still required. Simply enable the required feature and boot to the installation media through UEFI specifically.</p>
  <p>Slips7ream can enable UEFI support in an <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.3_Disc.htm" title="Glossary - Disc / ISO">ISO</a> by copying some EFI-support files to the right folders and ensuring the File System can be read by the UEFI. If you can find and integrate the right drivers, installation may be successful, but Safe Mode and other things that rely on vga.sys will fail.</p>
