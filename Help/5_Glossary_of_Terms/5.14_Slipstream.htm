  <h3>Section 5.14</h3>
  <h1>Slipstream</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Slipstreaming is the act of integrating installations into a larger installation - most commonly, <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.18_Windows_Update.htm" title="Glossary - Windows Update">Updates</a> into <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.3_Disc.htm" title="Glossary - Disc / ISO">Install ISOs</a>.</p>
  <p>Integrating updates saves time, money, and gigabytes of internet transfer data by putting them right in the Windows 7 Installer so they're already <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.11_Integrated_Windows_Update.htm" title="Glossary - Integrated Windows Update">installed</a> by the time you see the desktop. The cost is in the size of the installer, more specifically the <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.8_Image.htm" title="Glossary - Image / WIM">Windows Image</a>. There is also some increase in installation time, and it may be necessary to <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.15_Split.htm" title="Glossary - Split">Split</a> the installer into more manageable pieces.</p>
  <p>The <a href="/3_Slipstream_Process/3.0_Slipstream_Process.htm" title="Slipstream Process">Slipstream Process</a> can take many hours to complete, and may require significant temporary storage space, but Slips7ream tries to make the process easy and convenient, with <a href="/2_Configuration/2.0_Configuration.htm" title="Configuration">settings</a> and <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.9_On_Completion.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - On Completion">automations</a> to simplify your experience.</p>
