  <h1>Service Pack</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>A Service Pack is a large collection of updates and core Operating System component improvements. They will often replace the need for older updates, and in the case of Service Pack 1 for Windows 7, defunct some <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.11_Integrated_Windows_Update.htm" title="Glossary - Integrated Windows Update">Language Packages</a>.</p>
  <p>Windows 7 has only one Service Pack, which Slips7ream can <a href="/1_Slips7ream_Interface/1.4_Service_Pack.htm" title="Slips7ream Interface - Service Pack">integrate</a> into the Windows installer. However, the <a href="/5_Glossary_of_Terms/5.2_64-Bit.htm" title="Glossary - 64-Bit / x64 / amd64">64-Bit</a> variant requires a 64-Bit Operating System to be used for the process, because part of the procedure is running the Service Pack EXE to let it extract itself, and 64-Bit programs do not run on 32-Bit Operating Systems.</p>
